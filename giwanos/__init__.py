giwanos_agent

This package provides a skeleton implementation for adding agent functionality
to the GIWANOS system. It defines a set of base classes and role-specific
agent classes (e.g. judge, loop, reflection, reporting) that can be used
to orchestrate complex workflows. The actual business logic should be
implemented by integrating existing GIWANOS scripts and modules into these
agents.
